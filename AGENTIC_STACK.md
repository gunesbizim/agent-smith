## MCP Tool Reference by Server

### gitnexus

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `gitnexus_query` | Find execution flows related to a concept. Run before reading source files. |
| `gitnexus_impact` | Blast radius for a symbol: d=1 = WILL BREAK, d=2 = LIKELY, d=3 = MAY. **Mandatory before editing any symbol.** |
| `gitnexus_context` | 360° view of a symbol — callers, callees, processes it participates in. |
| `gitnexus_detect_changes` | Map current git diff to affected flows and symbols. **Run before every commit.** |
| `gitnexus_rename` | Coordinated multi-file rename using the call graph (dry_run=true first). |
| `gitnexus_cypher` | Raw Cypher graph queries — custom call chain traces. |
| `gitnexus_list_repos` | List indexed repositories. |

**Resources (lightweight reads):**

| URI | Content |
|-----|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/{name}/context` | Stats + staleness check |
| `gitnexus://repo/{name}/clusters` | Functional areas with cohesion scores |
| `gitnexus://repo/{name}/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/{name}/process/{name}` | Step-by-step trace for one flow |
| `gitnexus://repo/{name}/schema` | Graph schema for Cypher queries |

### git-memory

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `search_git_history` | Semantic search across all commits. Score > 0.7 = highly relevant. |
| `commits_touching_file` | All commits that modified a specific file, newest first. |
| `bug_fix_history` | Fix/security/hotfix commits for a component. |
| `architecture_decisions` | Refactor/migration/arch commits — "why was this designed this way?" |
| `latest_commits` | N most recent indexed commits — for regression investigation. |

### serena

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `find_symbol` | Exact file + line for a class or method. |
| `find_implementations` | All concrete implementations of an abstract base. |
| `find_referencing_symbols` | All call sites for a function. |
| `get_symbols_overview` | All symbols defined in a file. |
| `get_diagnostics_for_file` | LSP diagnostics — catch import errors and type issues immediately. |
| `find_declaration` | Jump to declaration of a symbol. |
| `replace_symbol_body` | Replace the body of a symbol in-place. |
| `insert_after_symbol` / `insert_before_symbol` | Insert code relative to a symbol. |
| `safe_delete_symbol` | Delete only if no references exist. |
| `rename_symbol` | Rename across all referencing files (LSP-backed). |

### sonarqube

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `issues` | List open issues with severity/type filters. |
| `quality_gate_status` | Pass/fail status for the project. |
| `hotspots` | Security hotspots requiring review. |
| `measures_component` | Coverage, duplication, reliability metrics. |
| `source_code` | View annotated source with issue markers. |
| `markIssueFalsePositive` / `markIssueWontFix` | Resolve issues with rationale. |

### sentrux

Real-time architectural sensor. Exposes `quality_signal` (0–10000) derived from five root causes: acyclicity (Tarjan SCC cycle count), depth (max dependency depth), equality (Gini of per-function cyclomatic complexity), redundancy (dead+dup ratio), and modularity (Newman Q). Start with `sentrux --mcp` (stdio).

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `scan(path)` | Full architectural scan — returns `quality_signal`, `files`, `bottleneck`, and `root_causes` with `score` + `raw` per dimension. **Run at session start to establish baseline.** |
| `health()` | Metric breakdown by dimension — inspect individual scores without a full rescan. |
| `session_start()` | Save a quality-signal baseline for the current work session. **Call at the start of IMPLEMENT phase.** |
| `session_end()` | Compare current signal against baseline — returns `{ pass, signal_before, signal_after, summary }`. **Call at end of REVIEW phase as regression gate.** |
| `rescan(path)` | Re-run scan after code changes; cheaper than a cold `scan` when the project is already indexed. |
| `check_rules()` | Validate `.sentrux/rules.toml` against live metrics — reports which thresholds are violated. **Run before PR.** |
| `evolution()` | Quality-signal trend over time — useful for tracking architectural drift across sprints. |
| `dsm(path)` | Render the dependency structure matrix — visualise coupling between modules. |
| `test_gaps()` | Identify undertested high-risk modules ranked by cyclomatic complexity and coupling. |

### ouroboros

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `ouroboros_pm_interview` | Interactive PM interview — generates ACs from business requirements. |
| `ouroboros_interview` | Developer seed interview for implementation planning. |
| `ouroboros_generate_seed` | Create an execution seed from a concept. |
| `ouroboros_execute_seed` | Run a seed to generate implementation output. |
| `ouroboros_evolve_step` | Iterate on a seed with new context. |
| `ouroboros_evaluate` | Evaluate output quality against criteria. |
| `ouroboros_qa` | QA pass on generated content. |
| `ouroboros_lateral_think` | Generate alternative approaches to a problem. |

### mempalace

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `mempalace_kg_add` | Add a node/fact to the knowledge graph. |
| `mempalace_kg_query` | Query the knowledge graph. |
| `mempalace_search` | Full-text search across all memory. |
| `mempalace_get_drawer` / `mempalace_list_drawers` | Retrieve stored memory drawers. |
| `mempalace_create_tunnel` / `mempalace_find_tunnels` | Link related memory nodes. |
| `mempalace_diary_read` / `mempalace_diary_write` | Session-scoped journal. |

## GitNexus MCP Skills (`.claude/skills/gitnexus/`)

These are skill files that load automatically when GitNexus tasks are invoked:

| Skill File | When loaded |
|-----------|-------------|
| `gitnexus-guide` | User asks "what GitNexus tools are available?" / "how do I use GitNexus?" |
| `gitnexus-exploring` | "How does X work?", "Show me the auth flow", "What calls this function?" |
| `gitnexus-impact-analysis` | "What breaks if I change X?", "What depends on this?", blast radius requests |
| `gitnexus-debugging` | "Why is X failing?", "Trace this error", "This endpoint returns 500" |
| `gitnexus-refactoring` | "Rename this function", "Extract this into a module", "Split this service" |
| `gitnexus-cli` | "Index this repo", "Reanalyze", "Generate a wiki", "Check GitNexus status" |

## git-memory MCP Skills (`.claude/skills/git-memory/`)

| Skill File | When loaded |
|-----------|-------------|
| `git-memory-search` | "Why was this built this way?", "Find commits related to X", historical context |
| `git-memory-debug` | Regression investigation, "what changed recently?", tracing all changes to a file |

| `git-memory-status` | "Is git-memory set up?", "How many commits indexed?", troubleshooting empty results |

---

## Mandatory 3-Phase Workflow

Every implementation task must go through all three phases:

```
Phase 1 — PLANNING (GitNexus)
  gitnexus_query("affected concept")
  gitnexus_impact("SymbolBeingChanged")
  gitnexus_context("SymbolName")
  gitnexus_detect_changes()

Phase 2 — IMPLEMENTATION (Serena + GitNexus)
  serena: find_symbol, find_implementations, find_referencing_symbols
  After each file edit: serena get_diagnostics_for_file
  Mid-impl: gitnexus_detect_changes() to verify blast radius unchanged

Phase 3 — HISTORICAL CONTEXT (git-memory, when touching code with prior fixes)
  search_git_history("topic")
  commits_touching_file("filename")
  bug_fix_history("component")
  architecture_decisions("design topic")
```

---

## Pre-push CI Gates

Run from `backend/` before every `git push`:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\ruff check . && .venv\Scripts\ruff format --check .
.venv\Scripts\mypy .
.venv\Scripts\pytest -m "not integration"
python ..\scripts\lint_role_decorators.py
```

## Index

This project's GitNexus index should be set up via `npx gitnexus analyze`.

If stale: `npx gitnexus analyze` from project root, then restart Claude Code.
